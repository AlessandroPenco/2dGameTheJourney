We are three students of the the Ms of CS in AI at University of Genoa. This unity project is the final project of the Computer games course. 

We built a serious game to undestand the '5 levels of accepting change'.

We thuoght this game mainly to the children that should accept a traumatic event during a 2d platform game in which the player should collect items during their journey in which will took choices to help doctors to understand the mental state of the patience.
